**Hands-On Docker** was written to be a self-paced and progressive means to learn the essentials of Docker. It is written as a series of practical labs.

Each lab builds upon the last one and goes through a range of technologies including: Node.js, .NET on Linux through Mono, Redis (NoSQL). We look at topics like linking containers, persisting data and scaling up an application.

The Labs are available below under the GPL on Github, and a write-up below talks about how it's been used up to now. I hope you find it as useful as we did!

#### It's been tested

The labs were originally tested out over 5 sessions at ADP, Peterborough in the UK as an internal project with colleagues. I then spent some time working through their feedback and adapting the labs for a hackathon, meet-up or weekend-project finally releasing everything to Github.

On 30th March at an Agile Peterborough event I ran a session based on the labs with great support from colleagues at ADP. We had about 40 RSVPs for the evening and a full turn out. I started off with a talk, a technical overview of Docker, then participants went through the Labs on their laptops. We finished the night with a quick retrospective and gave out some cool raffle-prizes provided by ADP.
