This Friday morning was marked by a solar eclipse. In some parts the UK there was up to 80% coverage of the sun by the moon. The last eclipse before then was on August 11th 1999 and unfortunately I can't say I remember much about it, I'm not sure that the effect of it was visible from East England.

### Enter the camera oscura
Now it's never been wise to gaze directly at the sun and I didn't have time to buy some official eye wear either, so I put together a simple pinhole projector and used this to view the event. I cut a hole around 1cm x 1cm in a shoe box and then taped some foil over the hole and made a small pinhole with a sewing needle. White paper was then placed over the opposite side and it looked like this:

The projected image was tiny, probably about 2.5-3mm across but cleared showed the outline of the sun being obscured. 

Here is a small picture showing the projected image inside the box.

Considering that this was a last minute effort, I was happy with the results, it was only later that I realised if the pinhole had been further away from the projection plane that the image could be effectively blown up much larger and would become more detailed.

#### Solar energy production
It was predicted on the news that the amount of solar energy generated by photovoltaic cells would drop during the peak of the eclipse so I left my voltage logger running and have included the results in the blog post. You see a marked drop at around the height of the eclipse which slowly returns to normal and levels off.
