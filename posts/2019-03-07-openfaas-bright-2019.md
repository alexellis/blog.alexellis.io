Let’s talk about the impact of working on [OpenFaaS](https://www.openfaas.com/) full-time for the past year and some important updates for 2019 including how you can help and get involved.

## Looking back

Over 12 months ago [I joined VMware to work full-time on OpenFaaS](https://blog.alexellis.io/full-time-openfaas/) in the Open Source Program Office. While there I built out a team to complement the work of the community and to accelerate the development of both OpenFaaS (the main project) and to execute on my vision for [OpenFaaS Cloud](https://github.com/openfaas/openfaas-cloud).

Over the year I travelled to, and spoke at, around a dozen events and conferences around the world making many friends & connections in the tech community.

Here are some of the things I’m most proud of over that time:

* The number of contributors across the openfaas GitHub org increased 3.5x from around 50 to over 180 and our [GitHub stars reached 16k](https://kenfdev.o6s.io/github-stats-page)
* We gained several dozen [new end-user companies](https://docs.openfaas.com/), some of which gave us permission to list their logo on the website
* We have partnered with AWS Open Source, Weaveworks, Spotinst and DigitalOcean on technical content, tutorials and guides
* We won a second [Bossie Award from InfoWorld](https://github.com/openfaas/faas/blob/master/community.md)
* I spoke on [the CUBE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8UYZ1GXNTQ) about Open Source from a community perspective representing the project
* We got a [brand new mission patch logo and t-shirt](https://github.com/openfaas/media/tree/master/t-shirts)
* We launched a [dedicated documentation site](https://docs.openfaas.com/) and [blog for the OpenFaaS project](https://www.openfaas.com/blog) with end-user and guest posts live today
* We shipped several great features for [OpenFaaS Cloud](https://github.com/openfaas/openfaas-cloud) including GitLab integration, OAuth2, a personalized dashboard and [full automation](https://github.com/openfaas-incubator/ofc-bootstrap)
* Within OpenFaaS itself we shipped authentication turned on by default, a template store, the secrets API, a helm chart repo, read-only filesystems and new templates for Java and PHP

## Moving on from VMware

This has been an amazing year for the project and a key part of that has been due to my ability to focus as a full-time employee with a salary from VMware whilst keeping OpenFaaS independent. I am very thankful to have had the opportunity to grow and for those who championed my work and supported me during my time there.

As of today I will be [moving on from VMware](https://www.alexellis.io/goto/linkedin).

Historically the project has had strong interest from customers and potential sponsors. The community is pushing the project forward rapidly too. That gives me great pride and means I have the opportunity to consider many ways to keep working on the project myself.

> I’m excited about what the next year will bring for our project and community. Let’s make 2019 an even brighter year for OpenFaaS.
