Here's an overview of the video recording and some additional links that will prove useful for running Docker on your Raspberry Pi.

### Overview:

* Flash Raspbian to a fresh SD card
* Install and optimize Docker from scratch
* Run our first container
* Play with GPIO and buzzers
* Create an IoT doorbell with a buzzer and Python / Flask
