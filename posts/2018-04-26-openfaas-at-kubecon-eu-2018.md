[KubeCon 2018 EU](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe-2018/kubernetes/?utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=search&utm_campaign=kccnceu18&utm_content=a&gclid=Cj0KCQjw8YXXBRDXARIsAMzsQuUU04g5SRY6WyAHv_fD1cCaItqdTBaxy-MhsF6Y4OBs-J3yiEXe-XIaAvWvEALw_wcB) is just around the corner and I heard from the CNCF's director [Dan Kohn](http://twitter.com/dankohn1) that there could be even more attendees than last year's event in Austin, TX.

*Me with the guys from [JetStack](https://twitter.com/jetstackhq)*

Last year was my first KubeCon and I loved it! 318 people signed up for my talk on Serverless with Kubernetes & OpenFaaS which was [recorded here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgsxqHQvMnM&feature=youtu.be). I met loads of really smart and friendly people, but it can be difficult to know where to start building your network. So I wanted to share some of my highlighted sessions along with some opportunity to meet up in person and talk about anything from [Kubernetes, to Raspberry Pi to Serverless with OpenFaaS](https://blog.alexellis.io/).

## OpenFaaS @ GOTO Nights / Docker CPH

In the evening from 5pm Tuesday 1st of May I'll be opening GOTO Nights / Docker CPH with an introduction to Serverless with OpenFaaS and Kubernetes. This is a great introductory talk for anyone who wants to know about what Serverless is or is already kicking the tyres with functions.

Over the evening we'll be joined by great speakers like Kai Davenport who is speaking on [Dotmesh](https://dotmesh.com).

Look out for my friend [Stefan Prodan from Weaveworks](https://twitter.com/stefanprodan?lang=en). He is a core contributor to the OpenFaaS project and has worked with the community to [build a Kubernetes CRD for functions](http://github.com/openfaas-incubator/faas-o6s).

I'll be bringing some SWAG along with me and if you'd like to meet this would be a great opportunity to sort out your sticker game.

## Office hours

I'll be at the VMware booth for two 1-hour slots over the event:

* 10:30-11:30 Thursday
* 12:30-13:30 Friday

If you didn't know yet - I [joined VMware to work on open source full time](https://blog.alexellis.io/full-time-openfaas/). We've had some very cool swag made up (top secret..) just for the event so come by and grab some before it all goes.

## Recommended sessions

* [Evolving Systems Design: From Unreliable rpc to Resilience with Linkerd](http://sched.co/DquW)

Speaker: Ed Wilde, Form3
Time: Wednesday, May 2: 11:55 - 12:30

I worked for Ed many years ago building C# applications and doing TDD & eXtreme Programming. I'm looking forward to hearing about how Linkerd was able to add resilience to his RPC (remote-procedure-call) stack. OpenFaaS uses HTTP(s) for RPC so I want to compare notes and see the pros/cons of this approach.

* [The State Of FaaS on Kubernetes](http://sched.co/Dqwe)

Speaker: Michael Hausenblas, Red Hat
Time: Tuesday, May 1: 18:15 - 18:20

Now this session conflicts with the Tuesday meet-up, but if you are taking in all the lightening talks then this talk by Michael seems to be a good high-level overview of the work being done by the various FaaS projects on Kubernetes.

* [The Route To Rootless Containers](https://kccnceu18.sched.com/event/DquO/the-route-to-rootless-containers-ed-king-pivotal-julz-friedman-ibm-any-skill-level)

Speaker: Ed King, Pivotal & Julz Friedman, IBM
Time: Wednesday, May 2: 15:40 - 16:15

Rootless containers mean we can restrict the privileges a container needs both at runtime and at build-time. I'm really interested in this for multi-tenant systems and for doing untrusted builds of Docker images in projects like [OpenFaaS Cloud](https://github.com/openfaas/openfaas-cloud).

## Can't make it?

Here's three ways to keep the conversation going:

* Join me on the [OpenFaaS Slack community](https://docs.openfaas.com/community/)

* Follow [me @alexellisuk](https://twitter.com/alexellisuk) and [openfaas](https://twitter.com/openfaas/) on Twitter

Meet me at an upcoming event like [DockerCon US in June](https://2018.dockercon.com) where I'll be speaking on Serverless with OpenFaaS.
