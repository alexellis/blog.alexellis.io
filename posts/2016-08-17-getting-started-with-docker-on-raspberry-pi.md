I have put this guide together to help you get started with Docker 1.12 (or newer) on your Raspberry Pi. For simplicity we will use the default operating system for the Pi - called Raspbian. This guide currently works with most models of Raspberry Pi and I'd recommending using the Model B 2/3 or Zero.

Don't know what Docker is yet or what you could use it for? Check out [Understanding Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/understanding-docker/) from the offical docs.

#### Already using Docker on your Pi?

Head straight over to my [Live Swarm Deep Dive video](http://blog.alexellis.io/live-deep-dive-pi-swarm/) where we connect multiple Raspberry Pis to together to create a Docker Swarm.

### Preparing the SD card

Download the latest Raspbian Jessie **Lite** image from https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/.

> The Raspbian Jessie Lite image is the same as the regular image but only contains the bare minimum amount of packages.

I used to give instructions for using `dd` on Mac and Linux with a third option for Windows. Now I recommend Etcher.io which will flash your SD card in the same way whichever of those Operating Systems you use on your PC/laptop.

Download Etcher here:

[Etcher.io](https://etcher.io)

Now follow the instructions in Etcher to flash your SD card. There is one more thing we have to do before ejecting the SD card.

* Enable SSH on the SD Card

To help prevent Raspberry Pis around the globe from being hacked the RPi foundation have now disabled SSH on the default image. Just create a text file in /boot/ called `ssh` - it can be blank or you can type anything you want inside it. 

> Make sure it has no extension such as ssh.txt - it must just be `ssh`.

Now insert the SD card, networking and power etc.

### Install Docker

Once you boot up the Raspberry Pi you will be able to locate it on your network through the bonjour/avahi service.

#### Connect with SSH

```
$ ssh pi@raspberrypi.local
```

The password is `raspberry`.

For security reasons it is advisable to change the password of the user `pi` with the `passwd` command.

##### Optional customizations

At this point you may want to edit the hostname of the Pi. Use an editor and change the word `raspberrypi` to something else in:

* /etc/hosts 
* /etc/hostname

If you are using the Pi for a headless application then you can reduce the memory split between the GPU and the rest of the system down to 16mb.

Edit `/boot/config.txt` and add this line:

```
gpu_mem=16
```

#### Start the Docker installer

An automated script maintained by the Docker project will create a `systemd` service file and copy the relevant Docker binaries into `/usr/bin/`.

```
$ curl -sSL https://get.docker.com | sh
```

Until recently installing Docker on a Pi was a very manual process which often meant having to build Docker from scratch on a very underpowered device (this could take hours). Lots of hard work by ARM enthusiasts [Hypriot](https://twitter.com/hypriottweets/) has helped make `.deb` packages a first-class citizen in Docker's own CI process. 

If you would like to opt into using a testing version then replace `get.docker.com` with `test.docker.com`. This will bring down a newer version but it may still have some open issues associated with it.

> Beware that this work does not extend to non-Debian distributions such as [Arch Linux](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/docker-git/) or Fedora. Arch Linux for ARM currently has Docker 1.11 available in its package manager `pacman`. 

### Configure Docker

There are a couple of manual steps needed to get the best experience.

#### Set Docker to auto-start

```
$ sudo systemctl enable docker
```

You can now reboot the Pi, or start the Docker daemon with:

```
$ sudo systemctl start docker
```

#### Enable Docker client

The Docker client can only be used by root or members of the docker group. Add `pi` or your equivalent user to the `docker` group:

```
$ sudo usermod -aG docker pi
```

After making this change, log out and reconnect with `ssh`.

### Using Docker

Support for ARM and the Raspberry Pi is a work-in-progress item which means there are a few things you should know.

#### Pulling images from the Hub

If you pull down the `busybox` image from the Docker hub it will not function correctly. This is because the contents are designed for a regular PC or the x86_64 architecture. There are on-going efforts to fix this in future versions of Docker.

We should only attempt to use images which we know are designed to work on ARM. At present there are no strictly official images but the Docker team maintains a number of experimental images under the prefix [arm32v6](https://hub.docker.com/r/arm32v6). 

> Update 30th May 2017: the `armhf` account has been renamed to `arm32v6` - so for future reference use the `arm32v6` prefix instead.

#### Running your first ARM image

Let's try starting Docker's official Alpine Linux image `arm32v6/alpine`. Alpine Linux is a very compact 1.8MB download.

```
$ docker run -ti arm32v6/alpine:3.5 /bin/sh

/ # cat /etc/os-release 
NAME="Alpine Linux"
ID=alpine
VERSION_ID=3.5.2
PRETTY_NAME="Alpine Linux v3.5"
HOME_URL="http://alpinelinux.org"
BUG_REPORT_URL="http://bugs.alpinelinux.org"

/ # echo "Hi, this is a tiny Linux distribution!" | base64 
SGksIHRoaXMgaXMgYSB0aW55IExpbnV4IGRpc3RyaWJ1dGlvbiEK

/ # echo "SGksIHRoaXMgaXMgYSB0aW55IExpbnV4IGRpc3RyaWJ1dGlvbiEK" | base64 -d
Hi, this is a tiny Linux distribution!

/ # exit
```

Try the image and type `exit` when you are finished.

We launched `sh` - a BusyBox shell, but we could have launched any command directly.

Here's another example without using the shell - we just run the `date` binary directly:

```
$ docker run arm32v6/alpine:3.5 date
Sun Mar 12 21:00:45 UTC 2017
```

**Other base images**

An image made by [Resin.io](http://resin.io) is used by the [current Docker build](https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/master/contrib/builder/deb/armhf/raspbian-jessie/Dockerfile) process to create a base image which is usable on all supported versions of the Raspberry Pi. It is a light-weight version of Raspbian Jessie which makes it a good choice.

#### Build a new image

Build your image like a regular Docker image but use `resin/rpi-raspbian` as your base. Let's add `curl` and `ca-certificates` and create an image which will access docker.com.

```
FROM resin/rpi-raspbian:latest
ENTRYPOINT []

RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get -qy install curl ca-certificates

CMD ["curl", "https://docker.com"]
```

Line-by line breakdown:

* FROM - this statement is the first in the file and picks what base system to start making changes on top of
* ENTRYPOINT [] - the Resin image has a pre-defined start-up instruction so this line cancels that out allow us to use our own.
* RUN - each step prefixed by RUN is executed by bash. So here we install curl and common SSL certificate
* CMD - this is the start-up command for the container, it's invoked by `docker run`

So build the image like this, and then run it:

```
$ docker build -t curl_docker .
$ docker run curl_docker
```

After building an image with Docker you will see it in your library. Use the `docker images` command to see all the images you've built so far.

If you want to delete the `curl_docker` image type in: `docker rmi curl_docker`. 

**The same with Alpine Linux**

Alpine Linux doesn't use `apt-get` to package its packages but a tool named `apk`, here's how to achieve the same thing:

```
FROM arm32v6/alpine:3.5

RUN apk add --no-cache curl ca-certificates

CMD ["curl", "https://docker.com"]
```

To build and run the Alpine container, you can do exactly the same thing or use a different image name:

```
$ docker build -t curl_docker_alpine .

#### Create a Node.js application

This Dockerfile uses Resin.io's Raspbian image as a base and pulls down Node 4.5 LTS from the official Node.js site.

```
FROM resin/rpi-raspbian:latest
ENTRYPOINT []

RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get -qy install curl \
                build-essential python \
                ca-certificates
WORKDIR /root/
RUN curl -O \
  https://nodejs.org/dist/v4.5.0/node-v4.5.0-linux-armv6l.tar.gz
RUN tar -xvf node-*.tar.gz -C /usr/local \
  --strip-components=1

CMD ["node"]
```

To build and run the image:

```
$ docker build -t node:arm .
$ docker run -ti node:arm
>
```

You can now test out a few Node.js instructions or fork my simple [hello-world microservice](https://github.com/alexellis/arm-alpinehello) on Github to take it further. 

```
> process.version
'v4.5.0'
> var fs = require('fs');
> console.log(fs.readFileSync("/etc/hosts", "utf8"));
> process.exit()
$ 
```

#### Make use of GPIO

In order to make use of additional hardware and add-on boards you will need to access the GPIO pins. These require an additional flag at runtime of `--privileged` to allow the container to write to the special area of memory managing GPIO.

The standard RPi.GPIO library will work through Docker including the libraries from several hardware manufactures. 

This is a sample Dockerfile for using the defacto RPi.GPIO library. 

```
FROM resin/rpi-raspbian:latest
ENTRYPOINT []

RUN apt-get -q update && \
	apt-get -qy install \
        python python-pip \
        python-dev python-pip gcc make  

RUN pip install rpi.gpio
```

Build this image as a basis for adding your GPIO scripts at a later date.

```
$ docker build -t gpio-base .
```

The following Python code can be used to will blink an LED connected to GPIO pin 18.

```
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
import time
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
led_pin = 17
GPIO.setup(led_pin, GPIO.OUT)

while(True):
    GPIO.output(led_pin, GPIO.HIGH)
    time.sleep(1)
    GPIO.output(led_pin, GPIO.LOW)
    time.sleep(1)

```
*app.py*

![](/content/images/2016/08/Screen-Shot-2016-08-20-at-09-40-46-1.png)

Just use `ADD` to transfer the script into a new image depriving from `gpio-base`:

```
FROM gpio-base:latest
ADD ./app.py ./app.py

CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

You will need to run this container in `--privileged` mode in order to be able to access the GPIO pins.

```
$ docker build -t blink .
$ docker run -ti --privileged blink
```

If you enjoyed that then how about making an Internet-enabled buzzer or cheerlight? Here's an example of using the Python Flask library to create a web server that controls a GPIO pin:
