In the video below I want to share with you some reasons why you should not be mining Bitcoin and despite what people may have told you - you can actually make money from mining cryptocurrencies with your [CPU and GPU with Docker](https://github.com/alexellis/mine-with-docker).

I'll start with a video, then give you a glossary of terms and two key resources that will let you dip your toes in mining cryptocurrencies.

### Glossary:

* Bitcoin - a popular cryptocurrency. It's now too hard to mine Bitcoin on your own
* Bitcoin wallet - a Bitcoin wallet stores your currencies and comes with one or many addresses that can be used in transactions
* Mining pool - a distributed pool of computers pooling resources to mine a cryptocurrency. This could be Bitcoin or something else
* Accepted shares - these are shares you have contributed to a mining pool and represent the work you have done
* Minimum payout - this is the amount of shares or payment you can accrue before it is sent over to your Bitcoin wallet
* Exchange - an exchange is where you can sell Bitcoin for other currencies such as Euros and Dollars.

### Further resources:

Here is my [Mine-With-Docker project](https://github.com/alexellis/mine-with-docker) which will allow you to start mining cryptocurrencies and get paid for the shares you submit to a mining pool within minutes such as [Nicehash.com](https://www.nicehash.com). All you need is Docker on your local machine or in the cloud.

My buddy and fellow Docker [Captain Tom](https://twitter.com/tomwillfixit) has put together a Bitcoin wallet where the proceeds go to charity. Find out about his project: [Techies 4 Temple St](https://github.com/tomwillfixit/techies-4-temple-street).
