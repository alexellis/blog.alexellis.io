You've heard of LAMP, JAM, and MEAN, but what is the PLONK stack? And why should you be considering it for your Cloud Native Applications instead of working directly with Kubernetes YAML?

## The PLONK Stack

PLONK is a cloud native stack for application developers and an acronym that stands for:

* Prometheus - metrics and time-series
* Linux/Linkerd* - OS or service mesh (Linkerd is optional)
* OpenFaaS - management and auto-scaling of compute - PaaS/FaaS, a developer-friendly abstraction on top of Kubernetes
* NATS - asynchronous message bus / queue
* Kubernetes - declarative, extensible, scale-out, self-healing clustering

Serverless 2.0 represents a move away from proprietary SaaS systems and embraces the leading open source projects from the CNCF landscape. Portability is offered through the use of a runtime contract and a Docker image. If your code conforms to the contract, it's fair game as a workload.
