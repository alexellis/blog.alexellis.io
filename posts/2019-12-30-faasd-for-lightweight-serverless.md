Kick the tires with faasd today, for a lightweight serverless experience that doesn't require Kubernetes. Instead it uses containerd and the existing OpenFaaS ecosystem.

> Last updated: 24th October 2020 - upgraded faasd & containerd versions. Added instructions for core components logs such as the gateway.

You can run [faasd](https://github.com/openfaas/faasd) anywhere, even on a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/), but why would you want to do that? faasd offers many of the benefits of containers and [OpenFaaS](https://github.com/openfaas/faas), but without the complexity and operational costs of Kubernetes. [containerd](https://github.com/containerd/containerd) is a low-level tool for automating containers, and a [CNCF project](https://landscape.cncf.io/).

![OpenFaaS and containerd logos](/content/images/2019/12/ofctr.png)

The use-cases for [Serverless / FaaS are fairly well-known](https://blog.alexellis.io/introducing-functions-as-a-service/), but you could use faasd at the edge, in a smart-car, as part of an IoT device, for crunching data before uploading samples to the cloud, for webhook receivers/alerting, bots, webservices, API integrations or even providing your own APIs. Compute is compute, and OpenFaaS with containerd makes it easy to both consume and provide.

## Before we start

Use Raspbian Lite (now called RaspiOS) for this tutorial. Do not install Docker on the same Raspberry Pi as it may cause conflicts with networking and the version of containerd we are using.

You should use RPi 2, 3 or 4. If you have only one Raspberry Pi, then you'll be able to deploy pre-built images from the OpenFaaS Function Store, but if you have a second Raspberry Pi, then you can use it to build new functions too.

You can also deploy to a PC or cloud VM:

* [Deploy faasd to DigitalOcean with Terraform](https://www.openfaas.com/blog/faasd-tls-terraform/)
* [Deploy faasd to your laptop with Multipass](https://github.com/openfaas/faasd/blob/master/docs/MULTIPASS.md)

## Part 1 - Installation

Installation only takes a few moments, and in the future should be quicker if we can secure binaries for containerd from the upstream project.

Since this guide was written, we introduced an automated script to set up faasd. You should probably use that instead, and then skip down to the walk-through / tutorial segment of the post.

So here's the easy way for you:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openfaas/faasd
cd faasd
./hack/install.sh
```

To do things the hard way (I know some of you prefer this option), then continue as per below.

### Get `faas-cli`

The [faas-cli](https://github.com/openfaas/faas-cli/) can be used to build, deploy, manage, and invoke functions with OpenFaaS. OpenFaaS offers a REST API, asynchronous invocations, authentication, metrics, and a UI out of the box.

Install using the utility script, or alternatively the binaries are also available on the [releases page](https://github.com/openfaas/faas-cli/releases).

```bash
# Install to local directory
curl -sLfS https://cli.openfaas.com | sh
sudo mv faas-cli to /usr/local/bin

# Or run with sudo to move to /usr/local/bin in one step
curl -sLfS https://cli.openfaas.com | sudo sh
```

See also: [OpenFaaS docs](https://docs.openfaas.com/)

### Get containerd

Unfortunately the [containerd](https://github.com/containerd/containerd) maintainers only provide binaries for `x86_64` (regular PCs), so we have to install Go and build containerd from source.

We'll install some dependencies that will help us in the tutorial and after installation

```bash
sudo apt update \
  && sudo apt install -qy \
    runc \
    bridge-utils \
    tmux \
    git
```

Pick option A or B.

#### A) Use my containerd armhf binaries (fast)

I have compiled binaries for containerd, which you can use if you wish. [alexellis/containerd/armhf](https://github.com/alexellis/containerd-armhf/releases).

```
curl -sSL https://github.com/alexellis/containerd-arm/releases/download/v1.3.5/containerd-1.3.5-linux-armhf.tar.gz | sudo tar -xvz --strip-components=1 -C /usr/local/bin/
```

#### B) Build your own containerd binaries (slow)

Raspbian needs a few additional build-time dependencies for containerd:

```bash
sudo apt update \
  && sudo apt install -qy \
    build-essential \
    libbtrfs-dev \
    libseccomp-dev
```

You can use my utility script to build containerd now:

```bash
export GOPATH=$HOME/go/
mkdir $GOPATH/src/github.com/openfaas
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/openfaas
git clone https://github.com/openfaas/faasd

cd cd faasd

./hack/build-containerd-armhf.sh
```

This could take a few moments on RPi2 or 3, and is a little quicker on RPi4.

### Configure containerd to start on boot

Install a systemd unit file for `containerd`:

```bash
curl -SLfs https://raw.githubusercontent.com/containerd/containerd/v1.3.5/containerd.service | sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/containerd.service

sudo systemctl enable containerd
sudo systemctl start containerd
```

Check that `containerd` started with `sudo systemctl status containerd`, if not then you may need to `unmask` it and run the commands again. See [unmasking a service](https://blog.ruanbekker.com/blog/2017/12/09/unmask-a-masked-service-in-systemd/).

### Install networking

* Enable the Kernel's bridge module

    ```bash
    # One-off
    sudo modprobe br_netfilter && \
    sudo sysctl net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables=1

    # Make it permanent
    echo "br_netfilter" | sudo tee -a /etc/modules-load.d/modules.conf
    
    echo "net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables=1" | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
    ```

* Install CNI plugins
  
  Fortunately there are upstream ARM binaries available for the CNI plugins.

    ```bash
    sudo mkdir -p /opt/cni/bin

    curl -sSL https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/releases/download/v0.8.5/cni-plugins-linux-arm-v0.8.5.tgz | sudo tar -xz -C /opt/cni/bin
    ```

* Enable NAT

    Enable NAT between the container network and your wider network and the Internet:

    ```bash
    sudo /sbin/sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.all.forwarding=1

    echo "net.ipv4.conf.all.forwarding=1" | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
    ```

    Optional step - if you have Docker running on your system, then disable it and reboot at this point.

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl disable docker
    sudo systemctl disable docker.sock # or docker.socket - You may also need this step
    ```

    Docker's IP address range conflicts with the one chosen by netns, this will be resolved when moving to CNI.

### Get `faasd`

faasd is a Go binary that runs on your system and packages all of OpenFaaS, it's a similar tool to docker-compose.

One of faasd's commands `faasd provider` runs an OpenFaaS provider which implements the OpenFaaS "CRUD" API for functions.

Clean-up old versions, if required:

```bash
# Stop systemd services, if you have them
sudo systemctl stop faasd
sudo systemctl stop faasd-provider

# Remove old binaries if you have them
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/bin/faasd
```

Download the faasd binary:

```bash
sudo curl -sSLf "https://github.com/openfaas/faasd/releases/download/0.9.9/faasd-armhf" \
    --output "/usr/local/bin/faasd" \
    && sudo chmod a+x "/usr/local/bin/faasd"
```

Now run the installation:

```bash
export GOPATH=$HOME/go/
mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/openfaas
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/openfaas

git clone https://github.com/openfaas/faasd --depth=1

cd faasd

sudo faasd install
```

## Part 2 - Post-installation

The `faasd install` command creates two systemd unit files which can be used to start/stop `faasd` and `faasd-provider`.

### Check the installation

Check the services:

```bash
sudo systemctl status faasd
sudo systemctl status faasd-provider
```

Find logs:

```bash
sudo journalctl -u faasd --lines 40
sudo journalctl -u faasd-provider --lines 40
```

You'll find your login details for the gateway in `/var/lib/faasd/secrets`, the user is `admin` and the password is in `/var/lib/faasd/secrets/basic-auth-password`

### Check the logs from the OpenFaaS Core Services

You can access the logs from any of the core services deployed with faasd as follows:

```bash
sudo journalctl -t default:gateway --lines 40
sudo journalctl -t default:nats --lines 40
sudo journalctl -t default:queue-worker --lines 40
sudo journalctl -t default:prometheus --lines 40
```

For more, see the `docker-compose.yaml` file in the current directory.

### Access OpenFaaS from your laptop

faasd deploys OpenFaaS along with its core logic `faasd-provider`, which uses containerd instead of Kubernetes to start, stop, and manage functions.

The `faasd` process will proxy any incoming requests on HTTP port 8080 to the OpenFaaS gateway container, you can also find the IP of the container in your `hosts` file in the `faasd` directory.

You can also access the built-in Prometheus container by editing `docker-compose.yaml` to expose its ports, either to 127.0.0.1, or all your network adapters.

### Deploy a function from the store

Obtain your OpenFaaS password. You need to run this command on your Raspberry Pi:

```
sudo cat /var/lib/faasd/secrets/basic-auth-password
```

Log in to the gateway, either on your RPi, or from your own computer.

```bash
# If connecting remotely
export IP=192.168.0.101
export OPENFAAS_URL=http://$IP:8080
echo $PASSWORD | faas-cli login

# Or on device:

sudo cat /var/lib/faasd/secrets/basic-auth-password | faas-cli login --password-stdin
```

Look at what's available in the function store for the armhf platform, then deploy something:

```bash
faas-cli store list --platform armhf

# Deploy figlet
faas-cli store deploy --platform armhf figlet

# Find the URLs for the function
faas-cli store inspect figlet

# Create some ASCII

echo "faasd" | faas-cli invoke figlet
```

Try a function that can generate an `identicon` like you may have seen for default avatar logos on GitHub.com

```bash
faas-cli store deploy --platform armhf identicon

echo $USER | faas-cli invoke identicon > avatar.png
```

Here's an example of the avatar for the user `pi`:

![avatar](/content/images/2020/01/avatar.png)

### Run an async function

You can also run your functions in the background or asynchronously.

Create a webhook receiver using a public service such as:

* https://requestbin.com/
* https://postb.in/

```bash
faas-cli store deploy --platform armhf nodeinfo

curl -d "verbose" \
  http://127.0.0.1:8080/async-function/nodeinfo \
  --header "X-Callback-Url: https://postb.in/1578562711776-8760500776115"
```

You'll be able to refresh your webhook receiver and see the value.

### Cross-compile a new container image

The easiest way to build an image is on your PC, using cross-compilation or QEMU and the `faas-cli publish` function:

```bash
faas-cli new --lang go go-fn --prefix alexellis2
faas-cli publish -f go-fn.yml --platform linux/arm/v7

# Or publish an image that you can also deploy to OpenFaaS on an x86_64 machine:

faas-cli publish -f go-fn.yml --platform linux/arm/v7,linux/amd64
```

Once you have published an image, you can deploy it from the PC to faasd with:

```bash
faas-cli deploy -f go-fn.yml --gateway http://pi-address:8080
```

### Build a new container image on a Raspberry Pi

You cannot install Docker on your Raspberry Pi running faasd because it will cause a conflict with `containerd` and our CNI networking.

Building on your server is not a recommended practice, so flash an SD card for a second Raspberry Pi.

You can also use one of my prebuilt functions such as [ascii-2020](https://github.com/alexellis/2020/), but you should only run the `faas-cli deploy` step.

* Log into the Raspberry Pi with `ssh` and install the `faas-cli` and `docker`.

    ```sh
    curl -sLfS https://cli.openfaas.com | sudo sh
    ```

    ```sh
    curl -sLfS https://get.docker.com | sudo sh

    sudo usermod -aG docker pi
    newgrp
    ```
    
* Log into the Docker Hub

    ```sh
    docker login
    ```

* Create a Golang function

    ```sh
    export DOCKER_HUB_NAME="alexellis2"
    
    faas-cli template store pull golang-middleware
    
    faas-cli new --lang golang-middleware \
      hello-world \
      --prefix $DOCKER_HUB_NAME
    ```

* Now publish an image:

    ```sh
    faas-cli publish -f hello-world.yml --platform linux/arm/v7
    ```

Note that the `faas-cli build / up` commands do not work with multi-arch templates, which is why we have separated out the commands for you.

### Deploy your new container

You can set your OpenFaaS gateway to point at the RPi where faasd is running.

```bash
export OPENFAAS_URL=http://$RPI_IP:8080

faas-cli deploy
```

Your new function will be pulled down on the first Raspberry Pi and start executing. Find the IP address / URL for invoking the function, both synchronous and asynchronous invocations are working:

```bash
faas-cli describe -f hello-world.yml hello-world
```

Now, try editing your function's source-code in `hello-world/handler.go` - get it to print a different message perhaps? The template we have chosen runs validation with `gofmt`, so if you've edited on the RPi, you may want to format the text before doing a build.

### Using private Docker registries

Private registries are supported such as the Docker Hub, AWS ECR, GitLab, or your own private hosted registry.

As an advanced topic, this is covered in my eBook [Serverless For Everyone Else](https://gumroad.com/l/serverless-for-everyone-else), the official handbook for faasd.

> Note: If you want to setup your own registry, [follow my 5 minute tutorial with k3sup](https://blog.alexellis.io/get-a-tls-enabled-docker-registry-in-5-minutes/).

### Logs

You can access the logs of your functions and microservices via:

```bash
faas-cli logs NAME
faas-cli logs NAME --follow
```

### Get a public IP and TLS for faasd

Inlets can help us to get a public IP and ingress to our functions, this is done through a tunnel to a host on a cloud IaaS or VPS provider such as [DigitalOcean](https://m.do.co/c/8d4e75e9886f).

Download [inlets PRO](https://inlets.dev) - "The Cloud Native Tunnel", it will act as a tunnel and a reverse proxy.

```bash
curl -sSLf https://inletsctl.inlets.dev | sudo sh

# Download the inlets PRO client

inletsctl download --pro
```

You'll need an access token for a cloud for one of the supported providers, see the list on: `inletsctl create --help`. You can also create your hosts manually and install inlets yourself.

I picked [DigitalOcean](https://m.do.co/c/8d4e75e9886f) and ran the `create` command to provision the exit server, this is the public-facing host with a public IP.

> Note: the host we create will cost around 5 USD / mo, for as long as you keep it running, you can run `inletsctl delete` at any point, or remove the VM from your dashboard. You can run an exit-node for free with some cloud providers who offer a free tier, or credits.

```bash
inletsctl create \
  --provider digitalocean \
  --access-token-file $HOME/do-token \
  --license-file $HOME/.inlets/LICENSE
```

> Note: you can get a free 14-day trial for inlets PRO to try it out, or purchase a license for personal use at a discounted rate: [inlets website](https://inlets.dev/)

After a few seconds the host will boot-up, download inlets and run `inlets server` in a systemd unit file. You can then run the `inlets client` on your RPi.

The `inletsctl create` command will print out a sample connection string. Just edit the `UPSTREAM` and PORTS variables so that they point to the OpenFaaS gateway:

```bash
  export PORTS=8080
  export UPSTREAM=127.0.0.1
  inlets-pro client --remote "wss://178.128.40.222:8080" \
        --token "525ed828fdfe11897b26b8a0d5359ef6c7ddd4ad" \
        --upstream $UPSTREAM \
        --tcp-ports $PORTS
```

> The `wss://` prefix shows that the tunnel is encrypted

Your functions can now be accessed via the public Internet, feel free to share the URL with your friends.

To access the UI and API of OpenFaaS you will need to use the Basic authentication credentials. By default, all functions are "open" without authentication.

In my example I have a function running called `ascii-2020` from [this repo](https://github.com/alexellis/2020).

From anywhere in the world users can invoke the function:

```bash
http://178.128.40.222:8080/function/ascii-2020?q=faasd+on+rpi3
```

**Get TLS and a custom domain**

You can get a TLS certificate for your tunnel, and custom domains by following the instructions in [my eBook - Serverless For Everyone Else](https://gumroad.com/l/serverless-for-everyone-else).

![Screenshot-2020-01-09-at-12.30.17](/content/images/2020/01/Screenshot-2020-01-09-at-12.30.17.png)

**Make it permanent**

To make inlets recreate the tunnel upon boot-up, just create a systemd unit file by adding the `--generate=systemd` flag to `inlets-pro client`

### Notes on rebooting/restarting faasd

Now try rebooting your RPi, you should see that the gateway comes up again afterwards. The functions that you have deployed will still be present, but scaled to zero, so the first invocation will warm them back up again, this process can take around 0.38 seconds. On a PC, this is even faster.

If you ever need to remove a function manually, you can do it like this:

```bash
export FN="figlet"
sudo ctr --namespace openfaas-fn task delete -f $FN
sudo ctr --namespace openfaas-fn container delete $FN
sudo ctr --namespace openfaas-fn snapshot remove $FN-snapshot
```

## Wrapping up

faasd brings a lightweight experience to your Raspberry Pi, cloud infrastructure and to bare metal, all without the need for Kubernetes. The solution is still under active development, so you may not want to put it out in production just yet, but we're moving fast and already have async invocations, authentication, and function store support.

If you felt like the installation process was somewhat verbose, then don't worry: we also have [an installation script](https://github.com/openfaas/faasd/blob/master/hack/install.sh), which you can also use.

### What can you run?

You may be wondering what to run on your new RPi with faasd. Almost any code should be able to run as long as it [conforms to the workloads definition](https://docs.openfaas.com/reference/workloads/). It could be an API, a blog, a function, a microservice, a [CLI invoked by our watchdog](https://blog.alexellis.io/cli-functions-with-openfaas/), or a simple webpage. 

You can also invoke functions using the various [openfaas event connectors and triggers](https://docs.openfaas.com/reference/triggers/).

### Checkout the official handbook - "Serverless For Everyone Else"

I wrote an official handbook for faasd covering the basics and much more more. It's a great way to start and you can use it at home or at work. You can get the eBook on its own, or a video workshop with it.

You'll learn how to build functions with Node.js - use configuration, add NPM modules, make HTTP calls, enable authentication, connect to Postgresql and then monitor your functions.

[Check it out on Gumroad](https://gumroad.com/l/serverless-for-everyone-else)

### Potential use-cases

Here's a few ideas off the top of my head:

* A Slackbot that can receive webhooks from Slack and respond to users
* A webhook receiver for GitHub to log or track statistics
* A GitHub bot like [Derek](https://github.com/alexellis/derek)
* Automation of home servers and IoT devices - use a function to send a call to your smart home?
* Host a website or a blog using the node12 template or React
* Download your favourite videos with the youtubedl function from the store
* Set up cron jobs to execute functions on a regular basis

### Try faasd on your favourite cloud, for work

You can use faasd on public cloud for real work too. It's ideal where you have a client project, and don't want to spend a lot of time maintaining and upgrading a Kubernetes cluster.

* [Deploy faasd to DigitalOcean with Terraform](https://www.openfaas.com/blog/faasd-tls-terraform/)
* [Deploy faasd to your laptop with Multipass](https://github.com/openfaas/faasd/blob/master/docs/MULTIPASS.md)

faasd doesn't need complicated server management or cluster configuration, you can even integrate a CI/CD pipeline using GitLab or GitHub Actions and within in a few minutes you'll have TLS endpoints you can update by pushing code a git repository.

* [Build and deploy OpenFaaS functions with GitHub Actions](https://www.openfaas.com/blog/openfaas-functions-with-github-actions/)
