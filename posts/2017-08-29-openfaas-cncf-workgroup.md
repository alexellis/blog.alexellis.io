On the 24th of August I had the chance to present and demo [OpenFaaS](https://www.openfaas.com) to the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation's](https://www.cncf.io) Serverless workgroup. This was a great time to reflect on what had been achieved since the first commit, show OpenFaaS in action and to talk about what was coming next.

OpenFaaS is an open-source framework for building Serverless functions on Docker or Kubernetes. You can read [my introduction to OpenFaaS here](https://blog.alexellis.io/introducing-functions-as-a-service/).

> OpenFaaS comes in one flavor - Cloud Native.

We also have some great SWAG on the way and have started to explore the [OpenFaaS](https://www.openfaas.com) brand. Read on for a quick summary, the video recording and some ideas on how you can get involved.

## What's in a name?

Once we found consensus in the community around the name [OpenFaaS](https://www.openfaas.com) I went ahead and checked GitHub, Twitter and domain availability. Not everything we wanted was available.

So we started to ask around and then had some blog posts get up to [#1 on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15062782) along with trending as the most popular [Golang project on GitHub](https://twitter.com/alexellisuk/status/897342022897602560) for several days and the most popular project overall for around a day.

No long after a few people came forward and kindly offered up what we were looking for.

**Official accounts:**

* Twitter: [open_faas](https://twitter.com/open_faas) 
* GitHub: [openfaas](https://github.com/open-faas)
* Web: [openfaas.com](https://www.openfaas.com)

> Thanks to Mark Peek from VMWare who also transferred openfaas.io and openfaas.org over to me.

**CNCF Landscape**

The CNCF landscape identifies key and important projects in the cloud native space. There's an [open issue](https://github.com/cncf/landscape/issues/137) to have OpenFaaS placed in the event-based compute space.

The project's name started out as FaaS, so we're looking at where it makes sense to use the new branding of OpenFaaS in [this issue](https://github.com/alexellis/faas/issues/123).

## Swag

You can order a set of 10 sample stickers for $8 / £5 including shipping from StickerMule. Here's a proof of what one of them will look like:

## Recording

This is the demo and introduction I gave to the [CNCF](https://www.cncf.io) Serverless workgroup - it's an action packaged 10 minutes covering everything the project has achieved so far, some practical demos and then what we see as coming next.
