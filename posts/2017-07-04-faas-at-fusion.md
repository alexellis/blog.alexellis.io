I headed to the West Midlands in the UK for my first visit to the [Fusion meet-up group](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/fusion-meetup-birmingham-june-2017-tickets-35370655583?aff=es2). I was to be one of four tech speakers in what was to become a packed evening. I spoke on Docker and how to start building Serverless applications with [Functions as a Service (FaaS)](https://github.com/alexellis/faas).

As part of my demo I was going to show Twitter data based around the event's hash-tag #fusionmeetup - so the organiser Hannah Mitchell helped me launch a mini social-media campaign.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We have <a href="https://twitter.com/Docker">@Docker</a> swag for tonight <a href="https://twitter.com/FusionMeetup">@FusionMeetup</a> ðŸ˜€ can everyone get tweeting using <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Fusionmeetup?src=hash">#Fusionmeetup</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alexellisuk">@alexellisuk</a> will pick the winner later!! <a href="https://t.co/EHsY5XxD5l">pic.twitter.com/EHsY5XxD5l</a></p>&mdash; Fusion Meetup (@FusionMeetup) <a href="https://twitter.com/FusionMeetup/status/880339297689366528">June 29, 2017</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The offer of Docker swag was a great catalyst and we actually had over 300 tweets by the time my talk finished. 

It was good to meet Hannah - the organiser and her team along with [Richard Gee](https://twitter.com/rgee0) who I'd been working with on Raspberry Pi and FaaS hacks. I also met [Luke Hennerley](https://twitter.com/LukeHennerley) after speaking to him on the [Docker Community Slack channel](https://dockr.ly/community) - along with many others.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/alexellisuk">@alexellisuk</a> super duper <a href="https://twitter.com/Docker">@Docker</a> Captain is here!! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Fusionmeetup?src=hash">#Fusionmeetup</a> <a href="https://t.co/nYuBqZ6Zyl">pic.twitter.com/nYuBqZ6Zyl</a></p>&mdash; Hannah Mitchell (@hannah_fusion) <a href="https://twitter.com/hannah_fusion/status/880509149687271426">June 29, 2017</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

One of the things that I really liked was how many people came up for a chat after the talk finished - you're a very friendly and welcoming crowd.

[FaaS](https://github.com/alexellis/faas) is an open-source project and welcomes contributions - whether through a Proof of Concept (PoC), coding features, testing or even just kicking the tyres.

### Wrapping up

It was great to see a growing tech scene in the East Midlands and to hear how companies are adopting containers and Node.js for their vNext applications. A couple of people also mentioned they were working with .NET - Docker supports Windows Containers - so checkout my [blog series on Windows Containers](https://blog.alexellis.io/tag/windows/).
