Tonight I'll be speaking about Docker at Digital People in Peterborough Meetup.com group. As a Docker Captain it's a privilege to come and speak with the local community. I hope you'll have your questions ready and for anything else read on!

Here's what Docker is saying about Docker Captains

> Captains are Docker ambassadors (not Docker employees) and their genuine love of all things Docker has a huge impact on the community. That can be blogging, writing books, speaking, running workshops, creating tutorials and classes, offering support in forums, or organizing and contributing to local events.

You can even [follow us all on Twitter by using a Docker image](http://blog.alexellis.io/follow-all-captains/).

#### Where can I get the slides?
