I spoke with Scott Hanselman on his Hanselminutes podcast just before the holidays about Raspberry Pi Clusters, .NET Core, Kubernetes and OpenFaaS.

Podcast: [Hanselminutes: Serverless and OpenFaaS with Alex Ellis](https://www.hanselminutes.com/612/serverless-and-openfaas-with-alex-ellis)

Tune into the podcast above to hear about how I became a [Docker Captain](https://www.docker.com/community/docker-captains) and what that looks like, how I started out with clusters and about my most successful project to date - [OpenFaaS](https://www.openfaas.com).

We also talk about some of my favourite Open Source projects like [Minio](https://min.io) and [.NET Core](https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/get-started/macos), [Colorisebot](https://twitter.com/colorisebot) and the OpenFaaS community.
